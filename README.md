##0x11. C - printf
#General

    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    You are not allowed to use global variables
    No more than 5 functions per file
    In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
    The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called main.h
    Don’t forget to push your header file
    All your header files should be include guarded
    Note that we will not provide the _putchar function for this project


0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life
mandatory

Write a function that produces output according to a format.

    Prototype: int _printf(const char *format, ...);
    Returns: the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)
    write output to stdout, the standard output stream
    format is a character string. The format string is composed of zero or more directives. See man 3 printf for more detail. You need to handle the following conversion specifiers:
        c
        s
        %
    You don’t have to reproduce the buffer handling of the C library printf function
    You don’t have to handle the flag characters
    You don’t have to handle field width
    You don’t have to handle precision
    You don’t have to handle the length modifiers

1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't
2. With a face like mine, I do better in print
3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print
 4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news
 5. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print
  6. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print
  7. The big print gives and the small print takes away
  8. Sarcasm is lost in print
  9. Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests
  10. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance
  11. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print
  12. Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection
  13. Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party
  14. The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring
